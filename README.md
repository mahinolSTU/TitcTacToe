Introduction
Application:
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player game implemented in Python using object-oriented programming (OOP). One player is human, and the other is a computer opponent. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3Ã—3 grid. The goal is to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends with a win or a draw.
